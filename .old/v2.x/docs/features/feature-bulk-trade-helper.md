# Feature : Bulk trade helper
Speed up your bulk trades by pre-adjusting whisper with the amount you need.

**Supports basic currency only for now (chaos, divine, ancient orb, etc.) other stackables coming soon (fossils, catalysts, etc.)**

## How it works
Open it with the button on the overlay

Pick up the currency you have, select the currency you want and optionally specify the `minimum` stock you want to buy, click search and voila!

You have a `whisper` button to send the trade whisper automatically in-game (`green` button) and a `message` button to talk to the player in-game (`purple` button).

## Why is it useful?
Let's say you want to buy 5 Divine Orbs for Chaos Orbs. You go to the bulk trade section of the PoE trade website, you select the currency you have, Chaos Orb, the currency you want, Divine Orb, and maybe you open up the filters and add the option for a minimum stock of 5.

You click `Search`... But you're not done yet, because you now have to click `whisper`, grab the slider, slide to 5 click the text below to copy the whisper, go back in-game and send the whisper...
Then imagine you have to do that a dozen of times... because we all know that most players don't answer (or not quick enough) so you'll have to repeat that over and over again... Pretty tedious right?

Well, the bulk trade helper of the application solve that issue, by pre-adjusting whispers based on the `minimum` you've specified!

For our 5 divines example all whispers will look like : `Hi I would like to buy your *5 Divine Orb* listed for X Chaos Orb in Standard` automatically, so they are ready to be sent and they will keep the native language of the player, so if you're whispering a Korean player, the whisper will be in korean!
