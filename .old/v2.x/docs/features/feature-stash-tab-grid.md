# Feature : Item higlighting

You have two behaviors that you can choose from in the `Settings` : 

Highlight with the in-game search bar : 

(Simple, but not 100% accurate, because items with the same name e.g. a normal rarity *Large Cluster Jewel* will then all be highlighted)

Highlight using the overlay grid  :

(Require an initial setup and the usual location of the item in the whisper, but it's 100% accurate and it's configurable per tab)

1) Allow you to configure the grid have an offset, because it's in a folder

2) Allow you to configure the grid be a quad-tab size or a normal-tab size

3) Display the stash tab name of the offer, so you can quickly find it
4) Allow you to adjust the grid position and size

5) Allow you to enable or disable the `shadow` effect on the tab content (which prevent you from misclicking and emphasis the item that you need to pick up)
6) Allow you to close the grid. The grid will also automatically close itself when you interact with the offer (e.g. send a trade request, invite the player, say it's sold, etc.)
