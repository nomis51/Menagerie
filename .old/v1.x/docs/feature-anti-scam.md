# Feature : Anti-Scam
When someone wants to buy something from you, a quick validation of the price and item is made to avoid getting scammed, if the buyer has edited the whisper.
## How does it work
Menagerie will look for you items on [www.pathofexile.com](www.pathofexile.com) when you receive an offer and compare the prices to prevent you from getting scammed if the price in the whisper in not the same. You'll have a visual indicator on the offer and a short description showing the difference in price.
