# Feature : "Translate-on-demand" or message translator
Let you quickly translate and send any message to any language directly from the game! No need to Alt-Tab and open up Google Translate anymore!
## How does it work
Automatically detect the source language (You can specify it manually if you want)

Use the button on the overlay to open the text field or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + T`

Choose the language you want to translate your message into, write your message in the text field and click on the `send` button to send the translation in chat!

Note, the translator might not always be able to translate your message properly or one part might be off. This can happen especially if your message is in a popular variant. For example : 

You want to send from english `Dat's gud`.
The translator notice that it's kind of english, but struggle a bit, so the translated message in german is a bit off.

That's why you can manually tell the translator what is the language you are using, so it doesn't have to guess what it is, with the popular language in the mix.
