# .NET 6 installation
It's one of the latest version of .NET made by Microsoft to build cross-platform applications.

To install it, please visit the download page on Microsoft's website : [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime)

Choose `Windows`, look in the `Run desktop apps` section and download the `x64` version. (If your version of Windows is a 32 bits one, which is very unlikely, download the `x86` version)
