# Feature : Chat scan
Helps you detect chat messages that may be relevant for you.

## How it works
You first specify comma-separated `keywords` (e.g. `word, some more words, hello`) that you want the application to be looking for in the `chat scan` section of the `Settings`.

Then the application will verify the messages coming from the `global` and `trade` chat that contains the `keywords` you've have specified. When it find something, it will show you a notification on the overlay :

You will see the message, the name of the player, the time and in which chat the message has been sent (e.g. global chat or trade chat), so you can quickly find the message in-game.
