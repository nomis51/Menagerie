# Feature : Anti-scam
Helps you detecting scams and outdated informations in your `incoming offers`.

## How it works
When you receive an `incoming offer`, the application will verify the price of that item using the [official Path of Exile Trade website](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search/Sentinel) by looking at the items you have listed. This is helpful to detect players who may had modified the whisper before sending it to you or simply the informations other player had about your listing were outdated (you know, GGG's API doesn't always update quickly).

You will have a visual notification if a scam / outdated informations may be happening :

If you mouse hover the item name, you'll be able to have more informations in the tooltip :

This can be enabled / disabled in the `Incoming trades` section of the `Settings` :
