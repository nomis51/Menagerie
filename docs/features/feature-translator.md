# Feature : Translator
Helps you sending chat messages translated from any languages to any other languages with a simple click.

## How it works
Open the translator menu using the button on the overlay :

In the translator, you can choose the `source language` manually or leave it on `Automatic` so the application tries it's best to detect it automatically. Then choose the `target language`, and finally write your ``message`` the textbox provided.

You'll noticed that as you're writing, the translated version will be displayed below the textbox, so you can preview it.

If you decide to change the ``target language`` after writing your ``message``, you can manually trigger a translation by clicking on the ``refresh button`` :

You can close the menu at any time with the `X` button. Note that the menu will keep any message there, so you can close the menu, do stuff in-game, then re-open it and continue your translation without loosing anything.

When you're ready to send your message, simply click the `send button`.

As you may have noticed, the message have been sent to the `local chat` (See the [wiki](https://pathofexile.fandom.com/wiki/Chat_console) for more informations about the different chats). This is because you have to treat the `message` textbox exactly as if you were writing to the in-game chat. So when you want to send a `global` chat message, you start with a `#`, when it's for the ``trade`` chat it starts with a `$`, etc. Same thing apply the translator.

So if I want to send a whisper in Korean a player called "player123", I would do something like this :

Fortunately for me, there is no Korean player with the username "player123" ðŸ˜‹
